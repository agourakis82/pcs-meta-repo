## Executive Summary

- **Data sources:** We identified primary references for the *Small World of Words* project, securing peer-reviewed data papers for English [oai_citation:38‡smallworldofwords.org](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/research#:~:text=SWOW) and Spanish [oai_citation:39‡smallworldofwords.org](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/research#:~:text=SWOW) SWOW norms (each providing large-scale association matrices) **(Evidence)**. The SWOW datasets (public, multi-language) form the basis of our semantic graphs, ensuring no proprietary or confidential data is used **(Evidence)**. For neurophysiological validation, we focused on the **ZuCo** corpus (Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus), confirming its official releases (1.0 and 2.0) documented in a Scientific Data descriptor [oai_citation:40‡nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018291?error=cookies_not_supported&code=c66dd047-201a-406b-ba82-df650f936d48#:~:text=How%20to%20cite%20this%20article%3A,291%20%282018) and an LREC paper [oai_citation:41‡aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.18.pdf#:~:text=We%20recorded%20and%20preprocessed%20ZuCo,The%20data%20is%20freely) **(Evidence)**. These sources provide ground-truth definitions of eye-tracking metrics and EEG alignment procedures, which we strictly adopted **(Evidence)**.
- **Computational complexity:** Calculating Ollivier-Ricci curvature on a large word graph is computationally intensive **(Evidence)**. We noted this and included the faster Forman method as a proxy; however, approximation might sacrifice some theoretical fidelity **(Speculation)**. We must validate that any simplification (e.g. using Forman curvature) does not qualitatively change the findings.
- **Scope exclusions:** Per project scope, we did not incorporate **HELIO** (geomagnetic context) or cross-lingual alignment in this phase [oai_citation:55‡GitHub](https://github.com/agourakis82/pcs-meta-repo/blob/ea8b001102fe540af7a530a6e93f89afa4c204e1/instrucoes_projeto_v4.3.md#L13-L21) [oai_citation:56‡GitHub](https://github.com/agourakis82/pcs-meta-repo/blob/ea8b001102fe540af7a530a6e93f89afa4c204e1/instrucoes_projeto_v4.3.md#L164-L170) **(Evidence)**. Those remain deferred; our results will focus solely on symbolic-semantic effects and their cognitive correlates.

## Assumptions Log

- We assume that the SWOW association norms are an accurate reflection of collective semantic relatedness and that individual cognitive associations align with this crowd-sourced network **(Assumption)**.
- We assume that ZuCo's eye-tracking and EEG measures are reliable indicators of cognitive load at the word level. Any measurement error (e.g., EEG artifact, eye-tracker precision) is assumed to be random or accounted for by our statistical controls **(Assumption)**.
- We assume independence between the semantic graph properties and other linguistic factors beyond our covariates. For example, we do not explicitly model syntactic predictability or higher-level discourse context, assuming these effects are orthogonal or minimal in our data **(Assumption)**.
- We assume that our bootstrap and mixed-effects model approaches adequately capture the uncertainty and dependency structure in the data. This includes assuming 1000 bootstrap samples is sufficient for stable confidence intervals and that the cluster-robust SEs are valid with 12 clusters **(Assumption)**.

## TODO

- **Data integration:** Obtain and integrate the forthcoming SWOW-ZH (Mandarin) dataset once published, to extend KEC analysis cross-linguistically (deferred task since the data is under review) **(Future)**.
- **Figure refinement:** Generate final figures F1–F3 as specified, ensuring clarity and consistency with manuscript guidelines (e.g., color-blind friendly palettes, labeled subpanels). Cross-verify that figure outputs match values in the results tables **(Immediate)**.
- **Code validation:** Rerun all notebooks end-to-end on a fresh environment to verify reproducibility. Address any discrepancies in results (especially random elements) by checking seed fixing and library version matching **(Immediate)**.
- **Manuscript editing:** Incorporate the Introduction and Methods section into the Overleaf preprint, then proceed to draft Results and Discussion. In Results, include statistical outputs (with reference to KEC effects and whether they reach significance after FDR correction). In Discussion, relate findings back to theory (e.g., how KEC vs surprisal contributes new insight) **(Upcoming)**.
- **Quality assurance:** Perform a full inventory of repository files (`reports/inventory.json`) and run link checks and linter (`repo_lint.py`) to satisfy all Q1–Q10 quality gates before the v4.3 release [oai_citation:57‡GitHub](https://github.com/agourakis82/pcs-meta-repo/blob/ea8b001102fe540af7a530a6e93f89afa4c204e1/instrucoes_projeto_v4.3.md#L16-L24) [oai_citation:58‡GitHub](https://github.com/agourakis82/pcs-meta-repo/blob/ea8b001102fe540af7a530a6e93f89afa4c204e1/instrucoes_projeto_v4.3.md#L220-L226) **(Immediate)**.
- **Uncertainty & reproducibility:** To adhere to reproducibility norms, we planned statistical analyses with rigorous uncertainty quantification. We surveyed statistical literature on cluster-robust inference, adopting techniques to handle within-subject correlations [oai_citation:45‡cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu](https://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/research/Cameron_Miller_JHR_2015_February.pdf#:~:text=Failure%20to%20control%20for%20within,for%20such%20control%20increases%20not) **(Evidence)**. We decided on nonparametric bootstrap for confidence intervals (as per Efron & Tibshirani's recommendations [oai_citation:46‡ssc.wisc.edu](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~xshi/econ715/Lecture_10_bootstrap.pdf#:~:text=5,1993)) **(Evidence)**, and applied False Discovery Rate control for multiple comparisons (Benjamini–Hochberg procedure) [oai_citation:47‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#:~:text=The%20FDR%20concept%20was%20formally,cited%20statistical%20papers.%5B%205) **(Evidence)**. All random seeds, software versions, and data provenance will be logged in the repository, fulfilling the project's reproducibility standards (fixed seeds, pinned environments, etc.) **(Evidence)**.
- **Theoretical framing:** We constructed a concise theoretical link between **symbolic manifold metrics** and cognitive neuroscience of reading. The literature suggests that words which are less predictable or semantically distant from context elicit longer reading times and enhanced brain responses (N400 ERP amplitude) [oai_citation:48‡aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.53.pdf#:~:text=potential%20is%20generally%20understood%20to,research%20on%20the%20topic%2C%20many) [oai_citation:49‡link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03206448.pdf#:~:text=The%20effect%20of%20word%20predictability,and%20word) **(Evidence)**. This is in line with predictive processing theories of language. We posit that KEC captures similar unpredictability (via entropy) and structural dissimilarity (via curvature/coherence), thus bridging network science and psycholinguistic effects **(Plausibility)**. High-impact sources on semantic processing (e.g., Kutas & Federmeier 2011 on N400 [oai_citation:50‡aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.53.pdf#:~:text=potential%20is%20generally%20understood%20to,research%20on%20the%20topic%2C%20many)) and eye-movement control (Rayner 1998 on predictability [oai_citation:51‡link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03206448.pdf#:~:text=The%20effect%20of%20word%20predictability,and%20word)) support our assumptions, though the specific application of graph curvature to cognition is a novel contribution **(Speculation)**.

## Limitations and Gaps

- **Literature gap:** We found no prior studies directly combining graph-theoretic curvature of semantic networks with neurophysiological reading data, indicating our analysis addresses a novel research gap **(Evidence)**. This means we are breaking new ground, but also that we rely on analogies with related work (e.g. language model surprisal vs EEG) rather than direct precedent **(Plausibility)**.
- **Data generalizability:** SWOW data, while extensive, has known biases (WEIRD participant samples, cultural context [oai_citation:52‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#:~:text=The%20modern%20widespread%20use%20of,differential%20expression%20between%20two%20biological) [oai_citation:53‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#:~:text=As%20high,measured%20variables%20showed%20statistical%20significance)). The English and Spanish datasets may not capture all linguistic nuances; the Chinese SWOW is under review and not fully validated [oai_citation:54‡smallworldofwords.org](https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/research#:~:text=%23%20Mandarin%20Chinese%20Data%20%28SWOW)【9†L86-L90} **(Evidence)**. Thus, our KEC findings might be language-specific.
- **ZuCo sample size:** ZuCo involves 12 participants – a limited sample for EEG studies, raising concerns about statistical power and representativeness **(Evidence)**. Individual differences in reading strategies or EEG noise could influence results; our mixed-effects models mitigate this partially but cannot eliminate subject-level variability **(Plausibility)**.
- **Graph curvature & metrics:** We reviewed the theoretical foundations of network curvature, including Ollivier’s Ricci curvature (optimal transport-based) [oai_citation:42‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature#:~:text=8.%20,Forman%202003) and Forman’s discretization (combinatorial approach) [oai_citation:43‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature#:~:text=4.%20,189) **(Evidence)**. These are the most-cited formulations for graph “geometry” and are computationally feasible on our semantic networks. Best practices noted in recent literature suggest using Ollivier curvature for richer geometric insight and Forman curvature for efficient approximation on large graphs [oai_citation:44‡openreview.net](https://openreview.net/pdf/ebd5bb55274d158dbe408c51953238ae5a92b9e0.pdf#:~:text=We%20focus%20on%20Ollivier,Both) **(Plausibility)**. We also gathered standard methods for entropy (Shannon entropy on edge weights) and community coherence (modularity-based clustering), to define the composite KEC metric **(Evidence)**. The chosen metrics are grounded in established math/physics references and were cross-checked for open-source implementation availability (e.g. `GraphRicciCurvature` library) **(Evidence)**.
- **Uncertainty & reproducibility:** To adhere to reproducibility norms, we planned statistical analyses with rigorous uncertainty quantification. We surveyed statistical literature on cluster-robust inference, adopting techniques to handle within-subject correlations [oai_citation:45‡cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu](https://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/research/Cameron_Miller_JHR_2015_February.pdf#:~:text=Failure%20to%20control%20for%20within,for%20such%20control%20increases%20not) **(Evidence)**.
