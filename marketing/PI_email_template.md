Subject: Prospective PhD collaboration — Symbolic Manifolds & Cognitive Biomarkers

Dear {PI_NAME},

My name is Demetrios Agourakis (MD; ORCID 0000-0002-8596-5097). I lead an open, reproducible project on symbolic manifolds and interpretable cognitive biomarkers (AG5/KEC) validated with EEG+eye-tracking (ZuCo). I am seeking a PhD host lab aligned with computational psychiatry / cognitive neuroscience / graph-based brain-language models.

Why it fits your lab: {WHY_LAB}
What we have: public datasets, open toolbox, Overleaf manuscript, preprints with DOIs.
What I propose: a focused PhD plan (12–36 months) to advance KEC into clinical-grade biomarker candidates and cross-linguistic validation.

Would you be available for a 20–30 min call? I attach a one-pager and slides.
Best regards,
Demetrios
