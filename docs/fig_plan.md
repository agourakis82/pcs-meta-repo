**F1 – KEC Distributions & Layout Diagnostics:** *Data:* SWOW-derived semantic graphs for each language (e.g. English, Spanish). *Transform:* Compute distribution of KEC metric values (entropy, curvature, coherence) across words, and generate a 2D graph layout for visualization. *Panels:* For each language, (a) a violin/histogram plot showing the distribution of KEC values among words, and (b) a network visualization highlighting one example graph (e.g. a subgraph or the full network in simplified form) to illustrate structural properties (such as a high-curvature vs low-curvature node). *Axes:* Distribution plots have KEC value on x-axis (for one component at a time) and density on y-axis; network layout has no axes (graphical illustration with legend indicating node size/color by KEC value).

**F2 – Reading Cost vs KEC (Partial Effects):** *Data:* Merged English dataset (ZuCo eye-tracking metrics aligned with English SWOW KEC metrics). *Transform:* Fit linear mixed models; obtain adjusted relationship between KEC and reading time after controlling for covariates. *Panels:* One panel per reading-time metric (e.g. FFD, GD), showing the partial effect of a KEC component on that metric. For example, a plot of predicted First Fixation Duration vs. KEC entropy, with a regression line (and confidence band) indicating how higher entropy (more semantic uncertainty) increases reading time. Points (or binned means) show observed data, adjusted for other factors. *Axes:* x-axis = KEC value (e.g. entropy in bits); y-axis = reading time in milliseconds. Annotations will note covariates held constant (e.g. “controlling for word length/frequency”).

**F3 – EEG Power vs KEC (Per-Subject Trends):** *Data:* Word-level EEG theta power (or another band) from ZuCo aligned with KEC metrics for each word. *Transform:* For each subject, compute the relationship (e.g. linear correlation or slope from regression) between KEC and EEG power. *Panels:* A grid of subplots (one for each of the 12 subjects) or an overlay in a single plot. Each panel shows that subject’s EEG response vs KEC (e.g. scatter of theta power vs entropy) and a fitted trend line. By showing all subjects, we can observe consistency or variability in the effect. Alternatively, aggregate into one panel with individual regression lines per subject in different colors. *Axes:* x-axis = KEC metric value (could focus on one component like curvature or entropy that showed strongest effect); y-axis = EEG power (normalized units). If multiple frequency bands are of interest, separate panels could be used for each band (with consistent x-axis).
