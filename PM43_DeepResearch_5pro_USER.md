# USER — Task
Assemble the Symbolic‑First preprint materials (KEC + ZuCo only).

## Questions to Answer
1) What are the strongest **primary sources** for SWOW (data papers; cross‑language releases)?
2) What are the canonical **ZuCo** references for the corpus, eye‑tracking/EEG alignment, and reading‑cost metrics (FFD, GD, TRT, GPT)?
3) What are the most-cited **graph curvature** references (Ollivier‑Ricci/Forman) and best practices to compute them in language networks?
4) What uncertainty/reporting standards fit **KEC** (bootstrap CI; clustered SEs by subject/sentence; multiple-comparison control)?
5) Provide a concise **theory framing** paragraph linking symbolic manifolds (KEC) to cognition/reading neurophysiology — cite high‑impact sources.

## Constraints
- HELIO is out‑of‑scope for now.
- Vancouver style; produce deduplicated BibLaTeX with working DOIs.
- Label each claim as **Evidence / Plausibility / Speculation**.
- Public data only; respect licenses.

## Deliverables
Please return these files using the required fenced block format:
- `Report.md`
- `references.bib`
- `intro_methods.tex`
- `fig_plan.md`
