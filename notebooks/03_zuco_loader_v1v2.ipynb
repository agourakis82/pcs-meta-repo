    "**Purpose.** Load token-level ZuCo **v1** and **v2**, harmonize schema, and export a unified file for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected inputs (if available):**\n",
    "- `data/raw_public/zuco/v1/` containing token-level CSV/TSV files\n",
    "- `data/raw_public/zuco/v2/` containing raw .mat files (currently skipped - requires word-level processing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on v2 data:** ZuCo v2 contains raw eye-tracking .mat files that require complex processing to extract word-level reading metrics (FFD, GD, TRT, etc.). Currently, only v1 processed data is loaded. v2 processing would require implementing word boundary detection and eye movement analysis.\n",

    "- `data/processed/zuco_v2_aligned.csv` (empty for now)\n",
