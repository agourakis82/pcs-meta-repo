  abstract = {BackgroundDespite intelligence being generally related to better mental health, individuals with extremely high levels of intelligence (also often referred to as gifted) are frequently viewed to be socially maladjusted, emotionally unstable, and eccentric. Although this view has existed for decades, the scientific data on this subject are highly inconsistent and suffer from several methodological limitations.Participants and procedureIn this study, to test whether the relationship between general intelligence and general mental health is nonlinear in such a way that at extreme values of intelligence the relationship turns from positive to negative the data from eight waves of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) were used (N range from 2,870 to 7,984), with intelligence being assessed at age 10, and mental health being assessed with several different measures at ages 16, 26, 30, 34, 42, 46 and 50. Quadratic regression, as well as spline regression, which divides the dataset into intervals, creates a separate regression for each interval and then smooths out the breakpoints, was used for analyses.ResultsThe results showed that the nonlinear models generally fit the data better than the corresponding linear models.ConclusionsAt high values of intelligence, individuals might begin to experience unique issues affecting their mental health, despite their mental health being at potentially the same or higher level than those with average intelligence. Intellectually gifted individuals have a large potential to have a positive impact on the functioning of the whole society. Recognizing and understanding their problems may prove to be of great importance.},

  abstract = {Chromosomal Mapping                            The conformation of the genome in the nucleus and contacts between both proximal and distal loci influence gene expression. In order to map genomic contacts,                                Lieberman-Aiden                 et al.                              (p.               289               , see the cover) developed a technique to allow the detection of all interactions between genomic loci in the eukaryotic nucleus followed by deep sequencing. This technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution. The map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state.                        ,              Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded.           ,              We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

The final part of the paper is devoted to important developments discovered long after von Neumann's work. Subadditivity and the interpretation of the von Neumann entropy as channel capacity are among those.},
