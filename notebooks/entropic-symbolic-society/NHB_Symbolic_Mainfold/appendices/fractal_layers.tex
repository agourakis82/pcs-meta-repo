\caption{\textbf{Fractal Social Layers.} A visualisation inspired by Dunbar-like layering in human social cognition. Each concentric layer reflects an exponential scaling of symbolic distance, aligned with fractal structures of affiliation: e.g., 5–15–50–150. The model suggests that symbolic intimacy decays logarithmically with distance.}
