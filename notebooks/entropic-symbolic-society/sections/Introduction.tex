\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Fractality as the grammar of form}

Fractal geometry is not static; it is \emph{alive, expansive, fluid}. With each scale the structure renews itself according to the same organising principles, rendering it at once simple and complex.\citep{mandelbrot1982}  Mandelbrot’s canonical definition—“a set for which the Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension”—illuminates a deeper logic: \emph{transformed repetition as the engine of complexity}.  Branches echo the logic of the tree; capillaries mirror the vascular hierarchy; local social patterns reverberate, enlarged, within civilisational architectures .

\subsection{Entropy: from destructive cliché to vector of organisation}

Entropy is commonly mis‑cast as mere disorder.  In truth, within open systems it becomes a \emph{vector of organisation}: by enlarging the space of possible micro‑states it forces macroscopic reconfiguration and, paradoxically, the emergence of coherence.\citep{schrodinger1944}  Biological metabolism, neural adaptation and cultural evolution are all staged on this entropic canvas.  Fractal patterns maximise energetic efficiency under increasing entropic pressure—the ramified lungs, the vascular tree, the neural connectome—and thereby preserve structural identity through constant renewal .

\subsection{From biological fractals to socio‑fractal dynamics}

If biosystems exploit fractality to resolve entropic gradients, why should societies behave differently?  Historical data reveal scale‑invariant regularities in urban hierarchies, economic cycles and technological revolutions.  Yet no unified framework explains \emph{how} such macroscopic patterns arise from microscopic symbolic exchanges.

\subsection{The socio‑Schrödinger conjecture}

To bridge this gap I advance the \emph{societal wave‑function hypothesis}.  Each individual or collective is represented by a symbolic wave function $\psi(\mathbf{x},t)$, where $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector in a multidimensional symbolic space—affect, power, belonging, ideology, memory—and $t$ is historical time.\citep{agourakis2025wave}  The adapted Schrödinger equation reads
\[
  \mathrm{i}\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}
  =\Bigl[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\mathrm{s}}}\nabla^{2}+V(\mathbf{x})\Bigr]\psi,
\]
with $m_{\mathrm{s}}$ the \emph{symbolic mass} (resistance to ideological change) and $V(\mathbf{x})$ the cultural potential field.\footnote{The full derivation is given in Section 2.5.}  Stationary solutions reveal high‑density symbolic zones—narrative cores, ideological strongholds—whereas tunnelling terms forecast cultural revolts and meme propagation .

\subsection{Aim and contribution}

This article formalises and tests a closed‑form, fractal‑entrópic framework for human collectives.  By maximising configurational entropy under wave‑function constraints we obtain an analytical fractal dimension $D$ and a bifurcation coefficient $\mathcal{R}_{\text{crit}}$ that anticipates systemic reorganisations.  Monte‑Carlo experiments and two centuries of census data demonstrate that the model reproduces Zipf‑like distributions and critical transitions with high fidelity.  In doing so, the work:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item unifies statistical physics, complexity sociology and philosophy of mind under a single entropic principle;
  \item supplies quantitative early‑warning indicators for socio‑systemic phase‑changes; and
  \item offers an ontological bridge between physical and symbolic domains, suggesting that society, like matter, \emph{breathes as a wave}.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.  Section~\ref{sec:methods} details the mathematical derivation and simulation protocol; Section~\ref{sec:results} presents numerical and empirical results; Section~\ref{sec:discussion} situates the findings within broader theoretical debates; and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} summarises implications and future work.
