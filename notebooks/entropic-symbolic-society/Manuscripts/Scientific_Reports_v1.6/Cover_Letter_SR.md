**Cover Letter – Scientific Reports**

Dear Editor,

We submit “Symbolic Manifolds and Entropic Dynamics...”. The work introduces an entropic–geometric coordinate system on semantic graphs (entropy rate + OR curvature), yielding separable cognitive regimes. The framework is fully reproducible (code/data: Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.16783257). Scope and tone are aligned with Scientific Reports; translational claims are conservative.

Competing interests: none.
LLM use: GPT-5 Thinking assisted code/editorial polishing; all content verified by the authors.

Sincerely,
Demetrios Agourakis (corresponding author)
