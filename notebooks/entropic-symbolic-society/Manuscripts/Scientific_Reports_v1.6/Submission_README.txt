SUBMISSION_README — Scientific Reports compliance checklist

1) MANUSCRIPT STRUCTURE
- Main sections in order: Abstract (≤200 words), Introduction, Results, Discussion, Methods, References, Acknowledgements, Author contributions, Data availability (mandatory), Competing interests.
- Figure legends concise (≤350 words/figure).

2) FIGURES
- Upload each MAIN figure as a separate file at submission/revision. Multi-panel figures must be a single composite file (a, b, c...). Preferred vector formats: PDF/EPS for line art; high-quality PNG/TIFF for rasters.
- Use a SINGLE PDF named “Supplementary_Information.pdf” for SI (S1–S5).

3) SUPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
- Combine all SI into one PDF. Use “Supplementary Figure S# / Supplementary Table S#”. Reference each item in main text.

4) DATA & CODE AVAILABILITY
- SWOW-EN citation: De Deyne et al., 2019, Behavior Research Methods, DOI: 10.3758/s13428-018-1115-7.
- Archive of derived data + figure source: Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.16783257.
- Public code: GitHub repo + Zenodo snapshot; include exact environment files.

5) LLM DISCLOSURE
- Methods note: “A large language model (GPT-5 Thinking) assisted with code refactoring and editorial polishing; all content was verified by the authors.”

6) LaTeX
- If submitting LaTeX, include the compiled .bbl file (Scientific Reports cannot ingest .bib directly).
- Numeric references in Nature style.

7) COMMON REVIEWER FLAGS
- Avoid over-claiming translational impact; call markers “candidate”.
- Provide figure source data; pin package versions; list seeds.
