    "# Notebook 03: ZuCo Data Alignment\n",
    "This notebook processes the **Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo)** data (both version 1.0 and 2.0):\n",
    "- **Input:** Raw eye-tracking and EEG recordings for each subject (e.g., MATLAB `.mat` files and associated sentence text files in `data/raw_public/zuco/`).\n",
    "- **Task:** Align each word in the reading sentences with eye-tracking metrics (first fixation duration, gaze duration, etc.) and EEG features (e.g., mean band power during word fixation).\n",
    "- **Output:** A tidy dataset (CSV/Parquet) where each row is a word instance (with identifiers for subject and sentence), and columns for reading time metrics and EEG features."
