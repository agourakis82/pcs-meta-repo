**Highlights**

* First continuity equation for symbolic entropy on a fractal manifold  
* Stable attractor at D₁ ≈ 1.17 survives even severe social shocks  
* Gaussian rupture reduces D₁ to 0.93 yet network recovers in 6 % of runtime  
* Monte‑Carlo grid (10 000 nodes) confirms the entropy‑optimal ratio D₀/D₁ ≈ 1.37  
* Framework forecasts post‑crisis re‑organisation in human and blockchain networks
