We introduce a dynamic‐fractal framework for social networks in which
the symbolic‐tie density $\rho^\ast(r,t)$ obeys both
(i)~a Bernoulli‑type flow that yields a stable fractal exponent
$D_1 = 1.17 \pm 0.01$, and (ii)~a novel fractal continuity equation
augmented by a rupture term $\Lambda(r,t)$.  Analytical treatment shows
that entropy is maximised when $D_0/D_1 \approx 1.37$.  Monte‑Carlo
experiments ($N = 10^4$, $10^4$ steps, $10 \times 10$ grid in
$\alpha$–$\beta$ space) replicate this ratio to within $2\,\%$.  When a
Gaussian shock of amplitude $\Lambda_0 = 0.8$ is imposed,
$D_1$ temporarily collapses to $0.93 \pm 0.04$ and recovers after
\,$\sim$\,6 \% of the time horizon, evidencing measurable \emph{entropic
inertia}.  The framework blends Hausdorff geometry with information
conservation, unifying Dunbar layers (5–15–50–150) and historical
crises within a single entropy landscape.  It offers bootstrap
confidence intervals, analytical–numerical concordance, and predictive
power for post‑shock reorganisation in human and digital societies.
