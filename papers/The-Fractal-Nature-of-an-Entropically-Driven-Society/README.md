## 🧩 Description

This transdisciplinary essay explores the entropic and fractal logic underlying human societies, cognition, and symbolic structures. By integrating concepts from thermodynamics, fractal geometry, philosophy of mind, complex systems theory, and quantum metaphors, it proposes a symbolic field-based model of collective organisation and gifted singularity.
